Sup guys, ZenBinary here.

Here are two py3status modules I wrote.

Mindful.py: Plays a meditation bell every 5 minutes.
	-Requires pygame and an mp3 bell file of choice.

Hosts.py: Toggles procrastination sites (fb, reddit, messenger, etc)
	-Has 2 supporting scripts: unblock_hosts and block hosts
	-Scripts swap out a modified and unmodified hosts file
	-Permissions gained via gnome policy kit 

Doubt anyones ever gonna use these, but I like them, enjoy =]
